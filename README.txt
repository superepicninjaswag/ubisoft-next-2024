My submission for the Ubisoft Toronto Next 2024 Programming Challenge :)

NOTE: My game does not account for window resizing so if you do so, the filled triangles will no longer be 100% filled

SOME WORDS
I've been preparing since Oct 4th 2023. While I am using git, I won't be sharing that with the judges because it could reveal my identity.
Instead I will log my progress here so they can see where everything came from. Since I created this file on Jan 7th, the first few features are grandfathered into the log on Jan 6th.


THE LOG
jan 06, vector and matrix classes
jan 06, threaded rendering
jan 06, ecs using sparse sets and pools for each component
jan 06, transform, mesh, meshresource components
jan 06, texture component (just colour information for flat shade and outline)
jan 08, clean up Vector4 and Matrix4 class
